# Diabetes Prediction Project

Welcome to the **Diabetes Prediction Project** repository! This project is the result of a collaborative effort by junior students from the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at the **Institute of Technology of Cambodia**. It focuses on building a machine learning model for diabetes prediction and developing a user-friendly web application to assist individuals in assessing their risk.

## Project Overview

### Objectives

1. **Predictive Modeling**:
   • Develop a machine learning model for diabetes prediction: The primary goal is to 
   develop a machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of diabetes using 
   health-related information such as age, BMI, glucose levels, and other factors. This 
   model will provide valuable insights and act as a decision support tool for early 
   diagnosis. 
   • Provide a user-friendly solution for rural hospitals: develop a web-based 
   application to forecast the risk of diabetes via machine learning methods. The 
   application provides a user-friendly diagnostic tool for rural healthcare providers, 
   bridging the gap in advanced medical equipment, enhancing access to early diabetes 
   screening and supporting underserved communities. 

2. **Web Application**:
   - Create a robust and efficient web application using **Django** and **Python**.
   - Enable users to input their health data and receive predictions in a user-friendly interface.

3. **Educational Goals**:
   - Apply principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **Introduction to Data Science (IDS)** to solve real-world problems.
